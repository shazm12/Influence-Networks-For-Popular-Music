# Influence-Networks-For-Popular-Music

In this project, I will be performing an analysis of the taste of the listeners on platforms like Spotify or Apple music or such and would try to mark all important insights from harmonic features of todayâ€™s music like timbres, usage of major, minor or pentatonic scales used in the production of music to even simpler aspects of music like whether the songs have some catchy beats or melodies or like how much proportion of listeners would like to dance or sing along the song. All of the following features would be considered and this will help to even address what proportion of listeners like to hear a particular artist or a song. This all will be performed using the link prediction with input as the graph content and contents and features of the song as well to calculate the highest accuracy scores which will further help me in the analysis proposed.
